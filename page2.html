      <h1>Computer Networks</h1>
      <p>Computer networks are systems that connect multiple devices, such as computers, 
        servers, and routers, to share data and resources. They enable communication and 
        collaboration through wired or wireless connections, forming local area networks 
        (LANs) or expansive networks like the internet.</p>

        <h1>Personal Area Network </h1>
        <ul>
          </li>
          A personal area network (PAN) connects electronic devices within a
          user's immediate area. The size of a PAN ranges from a few centimeters
          to a few meters. One of the most common real-world examples of a
          PAN is the connection between a Bluetooth earpiece and a smartphone
        <h1>Local Area Network</h1>
        <ul>
          A local area network (LAN) is a
          collection of devices connected together in one physical
          location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be
          small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to
          an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices
          in an office or school.

      <p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network
        that connects computers within a metropolitan area, which could
        be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given
        large area with multiple buildings. A MAN is larger than a

      <h1>Virus</h1>
      <p>A virus is a type of malicious software that targets devices like computers, 
        phones, and laptops, often through email, infected websites, or unknown downloads. 
        Its primary goal is to steal personal information, such as social security details, 
        bank accounts, or identities, which can be used for blackmail, fraud, or public humiliation.
         Viruses can also damage devices internally, causing slow system performance, random pop-ups,
          or unexpected logouts. Staying vigilant and avoiding suspicious links or downloads is 
          essential to protect against such threats.</p>

          <li>Malware is a type of software designed to target internet-connected devices, aiming to disrupt,
             damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems to steal personal information. Common types of malware
              include viruses, which disrupt device functionality; trojan horses, which disguise themselves as 
              legitimate software or websites; and spyware, which secretly collects personal data. Protecting 
              devices from malware requires caution and the use of reliable security measures.</li>
